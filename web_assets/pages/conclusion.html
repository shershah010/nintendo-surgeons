          The final controller we developed successfully reaches a preselected angle in a given time and returns to its original state. However, there were a lot of challenges in developing this controller. One of the first issues we faced was data collection from the camera. Before we got the vision algorithm from Joe, we hacked together vision collection code by using HSV filters, dilatation, and blindly modifying OpenCV parameters. While this algorithm worked, it was pretty hacky and was mostly gutted in favor of Joeâ€™s algorithm. Another was finding a way to remove transient data collected from the Arduino. Trying to develop an algorithm that removed transient data and was based in theory was very difficult. At the end, the best algorithm was to look at what part of the data was in steady state and simply average those values, thus removing transient data. Another issue we faced with the data was creep. The flex sensor took very long to return to zero after being perturbed, that the value of flex drifted to greater values than it should have. Unfortunately we found this out late into our project and could not apply a fix. On the controller side, solving the nonlinear least squares was a computationally intensive process. It took several hours to find a solution if MATLAB could even find one. Additionally, setting the weights for the PID controller was a trial and error game. With additional time, we could have better addressed these issues and added a few more features and experiments. We would have looked into a hyperelastic finger model, model the system as RPR, or using the EcoFlex finger. We would have also developed an external force model using the force sensor.
