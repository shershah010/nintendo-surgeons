        The use of soft robot grippers holds many applications for specialized manipulation tasks, including those where objects may be in a variety of shapes or require delicate handling. Additionally, soft grippers can be used in prosthesis. We utilized vision and bend sensor data to build a platform allowing for testing of various models of a soft robot finger, including that proposed by Daniela Rus. Additionally, we built an effective controller for the soft finger that uses the enhanced sensory data we receive. The end goal of this project was to develop a soft gripper model and some visualization of accuracy. This project introduces an interesting challenge because of all the different components that had to be put together. Using vision algorithms, data analysis, and controller design all came together to complete this project. Correctly collect camera data, remove transient data, and fine tune a PID controller using nonlinear least squares were some of the challenges we faced.

        Our projected was centered around the soft gripper named Dragonskin. Equipped with an Ardunio, bend sensor, flex sensor, and motor to provide pressure to the finger, we had all the hardware necessary to complete this project. Thankfully we did not need to build any special hardware for this project, but we did have hardware issues. One issue we faced was that the airtube that provided pressure was not properly connected so we had to tinker with that. Another hardware issue was setting up the Intel Realsense camera so that it sent its video feed to the lab computer.

          The final controller we developed successfully reaches a preselected angle in a given time and returned to its original state. However, there were a lot of challenges in developing this controller. On of the first issues we faced was data collection from the camera. Before we got the vision algorithm from Joe, we hacked together vision collection code by using HSV filters, dilatation, and blindly modifying OpenCV parameters. While this algorithm worked, it was an unexpected challenge. Another was finding a way to remove transient data collected from the Arduino. Trying to develop an algorithm that removed transient data and was based in theory was very difficult. At the end, the best algorithm was to simply look at what part of the data was in steady state and simply average those values, thus removing transient data. Another issue we faced with the data was creep. The flex sensor took so long to return to zero after being perturbed, that the value of flex drifted to greater values that it should have. Unfortunately we found this out late into our project and could not apply a fix. On the controller side, solving the nonlinear least squares was a computationally intensive process. It took several hours to find a solution if MatLab could even find one. Additionally, setting the weights for the PD controller was a trial and error game. With addition time, we could have better address these issues and add a few more features and experiments. We would have looked into a hyperelastic finger model, model the system as RPR, or using an EcoFlex finger. We would also have developed an external force model using the force sensor.
