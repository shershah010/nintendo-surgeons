        The use of soft robot grippers holds many applications for specialized manipulation tasks, including those where objects may be in a variety of shapes or require delicate handling. Additionally, soft grippers can be used in prosthesis. We utilized vision and bend sensor data to build a platform allowing for testing of various models of a soft robot finger, including that proposed by Daniela Rus. Additionally, we built an effective controller for the soft finger that uses the enhanced sensory data we received. The end goal of this project was to develop a soft gripper model and some visualizations of accuracy. This project introduces an interesting challenge because of all the different components that had to be put together. Vision algorithms, data analysis, and controller design all came together to complete this project. Collecting camera data, remove transient data, and fine tuning a PID controller using nonlinear least squares were some of the challenges we faced.
